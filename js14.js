// BUGS
// A bug causes a program to run in an unintended way.

function addnums (a , b){
     console.log(a+b)
}
    addnums("1" , 2)
    console.log("still running")
    // in this example 1 is used as a string and 2 as a number. 
    //The code is giving the output in string and it is not doing the addition.


// so in bug your code will run but it will not give the desirable outpu.
